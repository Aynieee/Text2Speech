# Text2Speech
This project is aimed at providing audio version of the vocabulary list for learning German [1] using Google's Text to Speech API [2]. Though the program is written for this particular purpose, it can be used with other input files as well.

With these audio files, one can read the vocabulary list and listen to them at the same time, making it easier to learn the words and phrases.
